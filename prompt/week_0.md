I’ve created a new Next.js polling app project. I want to prepare it for upcoming features like user authentication, viewing polls, and creating a new poll. Help me scaffold an initial folder structure and placeholder files for those areas. Use Shadcn components.

Act as a senior full-stack architect experienced with building and deploying scalable Next.js applications on Vercel using Supabase as the backend.

I’m building a full-stack polling app with Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and using Supabase for the database, authentication, and real-time updates. The app includes features like poll creation, voting (with live updates), QR code sharing, and user authentication.

Can you help me brainstorm and design the architecture for this app? Specifically:
    • How would you structure the Next.js project (App Router, route handlers, server components, etc.)?
    • How should the overall system be architected across frontend, backend, Supabase, and Vercel?
    • Any recommendations for modeling poll data and securing voting logic with Supabase?
    • How would you handle QR code generation and scanning?
    • What tools or libraries would you suggest to accelerate development and ensure scalability?

I’m building a login feature for my full stack NextJS polling app. Users will authenticate via email and password using Supabase. Help me break this down. I am not looking for implementation details but rather what is required to make this work and how does the integration with Supabase work? is there an initial setup required? ...etc

Set up user authentication for a Next.js polling app using Supabase and App Router. Update the login page and registration pages  and also create an auth context for protected routes to access the logged in user.
